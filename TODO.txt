### Probably

* Add additional arg to delete logs downloaded
* Add arg to auto filterFolder
* Add arg to change key to sort objects by (rather than c-ip)
x Tweak filterFolder to sort all folders within a month folder
* backcheck arg to make sure year entered is a valid folder

### Maybe

* Use a flags library for accepting command line args
* Accept piped-in input from command line
* Add arg for getting files by place in bucket, rather than starting from oldest file 

* create a lambda centered method
  * 2 independent parts
  * AWS Eventbridge runs scheduled event; Lambda converts gz files to json format, store in processed bucket, delete processed gz files
  * AWS Athena to query processed logs/create tables; AWS ElastiSearch(Kibana) for visual graphs
